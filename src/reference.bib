year={2002},
publisher={Springer Berlin Heidelberg},

pages={359--369},
abstract={Modular exponentiation in a finite field is the basic computation involved in most public key crypto systems, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, ElGamal, etc. The current paper presents a new parallel architecture whereby the modular multiplication and squaring can be processed simultaneously in GF(2m) in m clock cycles using a cellular automata. Since the proposed cellular automata architecture is simple, regular, modular, cascadable, it can also be utilized efficiently for the implementation of VLSI.},

	abstract =	{Implementors of systems that use public key cryptography to exchange symmetric keys need to make the public keys resistant to some predetermined level of attack. That level of attack resistance is the strength of the system, and the symmetric keys that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the system strength requirements. The three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength, and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any network protocol usage. While it is fairly easy to express the system strength requirements in terms of a symmetric key length and to choose a cipher that has a key length equal to or exceeding that requirement, it is harder to choose a public key that has a cryptographic strength meeting a symmetric key strength requirement. This document explains how to determine the length of an asymmetric key as a function of a symmetric key strength requirement. Some rules of thumb for estimating equivalent resistance to large-scale attacks on various algorithms are given. The document also addresses how changing the sizes of the underlying large integers (moduli, group sizes, exponents, and so on) changes the time to use the algorithms for key exchange. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.},

TLSv1.2 has been the recommended version for IETF protocols since 2008, providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Products having to support older versions increase the attack surface unnecessarily and increase opportunities for misconfigurations. Supporting these older versions also requires additional effort for library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC6347), but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.
